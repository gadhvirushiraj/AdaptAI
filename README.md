AdaptAI is a research project focused on AI-driven personalization to boosting workplace productivity and well-being. By integrating egocentric vision, audio, physiological signals, motion data and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), AdaptAI offers:

- **Physical Well-being Support**: Timely interventions, such as movement reminders and micro-break suggestions.
- **Mental Well-being Assistance**: A Tone-Adaptive Conversational Agent (TCA) that provides tone supportive interactions during stress phases.
- **Task Automation**: AI agents handle small routine tasks like scheduling meetings and drafting emails.
